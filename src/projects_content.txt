## SECTION: PROJECT 1 - AIPA [LINES 16-50]
16. AI Personal Assistant (AIPA)
17. 
18. AIPA is a full-stack AI-powered personal assistant that combines a modern React 19 frontend
19. with a robust Spring Boot 3.4 backend. Integrated with Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash API,
20. it provides intelligent, context-aware responses, automatic calendar event detection
21. from natural language, persistent memory capabilities, and dynamic plan generation.
22. The system features sophisticated input routing that determines whether user input
23. requires planning, calendar events, or simple responses.
24. 
25. Technologies:
26. React 19, Spring Boot 3.4, Java, SQLite, Google Gemini 2.0 Flash,
27. Spring Security, JWT Authentication, REST APIs, FullCalendar
28. 
29. Key Features:
30. Gemini 2.0 Flash integration for fast, high-quality AI responses
31. Multi-tier prompt system with sophisticated AI behavior templates
32. Natural language event detection — auto-creates calendar events from phrases
33. Persistent memory system that stores and retrieves user preferences
34. Dynamic plan generation breaking complex goals into time-bound steps
35. JWT-based authentication with refresh capability
36. Customizable themes (10 color schemes) with font size controls
37. FullCalendar integration with day, week, and list views
38. Session memory tracking for contextual awareness
39. Profile management with photo upload and password updates

## SECTION: PROJECT 2 - NLRS [LINES 51-85]
44. Natural Language Review System (NLRS)
45. 
46. NLRS is a JavaFX desktop application designed for educational institutions
47. to manage lecturer feedback. Students submit open-ended reviews which are
48. automatically analyzed using Stanford CoreNLP for sentiment analysis (1-9 scale).
49. Lecturers view aggregated sentiment scores, and administrators manage users
50. and generate performance reports.
51. 
52. Technologies:
53. Java, JavaFX 17, FXML, Stanford CoreNLP 4.5.6, MySQL 8.0, JDBC, FormsFX, Maven
54. 
55. Key Features:
56. Stanford CoreNLP pipeline for sentiment analysis (tokenize → parse → sentiment)
57. Sentiment scoring from 1 (Very Negative) to 9 (Very Positive)
58. Role-based dashboards for students, lecturers, and administrators
59. Anonymous review submission protecting student privacy
60. Unit/course-based filtering for targeted feedback analysis
61. Comprehensive performance reports with aggregated sentiment data
62. Authentication system preventing fake reviews

## SECTION: PROJECT 3 - AUDIOGLASS [LINES 86-115]
65. AudioGlass — Transparency Mode
66. 
67. AudioGlass is a Windows desktop application providing real-time audio passthrough
68. from microphone to headphones, emulating the 'transparency mode' found in premium
69. ANC headphones like AirPods Pro. Designed for ultra-low latency (sub-15ms),
70. the application runs its audio hot path in native C code to bypass .NET garbage
71. collection pauses, achieving performance impossible with managed code alone.
72. 
73. Technologies:
74. C# .NET, Windows Forms, Miniaudio (C library), Custom C++ Wrapper,
75. WASAPI, P/Invoke, NAudio, PowerShell
76. 
77. Key Features:
78. Sub-15ms latency achieved via native (unmanaged) audio processing
79. GC-immune audio loop bypasses .NET garbage collection pauses
80. System tray application with minimal footprint and quick toggle
81. Configurable buffer sizes (128-frame ~2.6ms or 256-frame ~5.3ms)
82. Input/output device selection with hot-swap and auto-reconnection
83. Adjustable passthrough volume (0-100%)
84. Persistent settings saved across restarts
85. Callback marshaling with GCHandle to prevent delegate collection

## SECTION: PROJECT 4 - CURTIS-WORKSPACE [LINES 116-150]
88. Curtis-Workspace — Interactive Portfolio
89. 
90. This portfolio website reimagined as a fully interactive Windows 11-style desktop
91. environment. Instead of traditional scrolling, visitors experience a multi-window
92. operating system simulation with draggable windows, a centered taskbar, snap zones,
93. and an AI-powered assistant orb integrated with Google Gemini.
94. 
95. Technologies:
96. React 19, React Router 6, Framer Motion, Google Generative AI (Gemini),
97. react-draggable, react-resizable, CSS3 Variables, Netlify Functions, PHP Backend
98. 
99. Key Features:
100. Multi-window architecture with independent, stacking windows
101. Draggable windows with momentum, bounds checking, and resize handles
102. Windows 11-style centered taskbar with open window indicators
103. Snap zones for half-screen, quarter-screen, and fullscreen layouts
104. Elastic animations matching Windows 11 behavior
105. AI Assistant Orb with Google Gemini integration and portfolio context
106. Split-view mode — AI chat snaps beside referenced content
107. Glassmorphism design with dark theme and custom cursor effects
108. Responsive design with mobile-specific navigation
